Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A.Data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed
 and modified efficiently. Data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the
  functions or operations that can be applied to the data


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A.A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.
 The most common operations performed on them are:
 - Insertion, to add items to it

 -- Deletion, to remove items from it

 -- Modification, to modify items

 -- Searching, to search for a particular item

 -- Sorting, to sort the items in a required order.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A. The name of areas are:

· Compiler Design,

· Operating System,

· Database Management System,

· Statistical analysis package,

· Numerical Analysis,

· Graphics,

· Artificial Intelligence,

· Simulation

what is an Array?
A.An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The length of an array is
 established when the array is created. After creation, its length is fixed. You have seen an example of arrays
  already, in the main method of the "Hello World!" application.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A.1- First and Major difference between Array and ArrayList in Java is that Array is a fixed length data
structure while ArrayList is a variable length Collection class. ... 4- You can not store primitives in ArrayList,
 it can only contain Objects. While Array can contain both primitives and Objects in Java.

what is LinkedList?
A.Linked list is a type of data structure and uses a sequence of nodes with the reference or pointer to indicate
the next node in the list. This article explains all about the linked list, its various operations and the linked
list applications.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
A.In array, each element is independent and can be accessed using it's index value. In case of a linked list,
 each node/element points to the next, previous, or maybe both nodes. Linked list can be Linear(Singly), Doubly or
 Circular linked list. ... Whereas, linked list gets memory allocated in Heap section.
what is queue?
A.Java Queue is an interface available in java.util package and extends java.util.Collection interface.
Just like Java List, Java Queue is a collection of ordered elements (Or objects) but it performs insert and
remove operations differently. We can use Queue to store elements before processing those elements.

what is stack?
A. A stack is a data area or buffer used for storing requests that need to be handled. The IBM Dictionary of
Computing says that a stack is always a push-down list, meaning that as new requests come in, they push down the
old ones.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
A.The LIFO, or last-in, first-out, procedure assumes that goods purchased last are the first goods sold. In turn,
 FIFO -- or first-in, first-out -- assumes that goods purchased first are the initial goods sold. When prices rise
 and recent purchases are priced higher than goods purchased at an earlier point in time, LIFO results in a higher
  cost of goods sold and a lower income than does FIFO. However, LIFO more closely matches current revenues with
  current expenses than does FIFO, and as a result, more accurately reflects the actual cost of goods sold. In turn,
  FIFO more accurately reflects inventory value in that units that remain in inventory at the end of an accounting
   period reflect current costs.

what is the order of complexity?
A.This means that it is a certain mathematical expression of the size of the input, and the algorithm finishes
between two factors of it. Generally, the smaller the order of complexity of the program's underlying algorithm,
the faster it will run and the better it will scale as the input gets larger.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?

what is tree in data structure?
a.A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear
data structures. A tree can be empty with no nodes or a tree is a structure consisting of one node called the
root and zero or one or more subtrees.

what is graph in data structure?
a.A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to
 as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. ... For example, in Facebook,
  each person is represented with a vertex(or node).

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
A.Hashtable is synchronized, whereas HashMap is not. This makes HashMap better for non-threaded applications, as
unsynchronized Objects typically perform better than synchronized ones. ... HashMap allows one null key and any
number of null values.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical
 data model.
 A: The major data structures used are as follows:

 · RDBMS – Array (i.e. Array of structures)

 · Network data model – Graph

 · Hierarchical data model – Trees


How HashMap works in java?
A.HashMap is one implementation of the Map interface. HashMap are efficient for locating a value based on a
 key and inserting and deleting values based on a key.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
A.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown to indicate that we are trying to
access array element with an illegal index. This exception is thrown when the index is either negative or greater
than or equal to the size of the array.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
A.There are mainly four different ways to copy all elements of one array into another array in Java.

  1. Manually
  2. Arrays.copyOf()
  3. System.arraycopy()
  4. Object.clone()

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
A. Difference between Array and Linked List. ... Basically, an array is a set of similar data objects stored in
  sequential memory locations under a common heading or a variable name. While a linked list is a data structure
  which contains a sequence of the elements where each element is linked to its next element.


What is DFS and BFS?
A.The breadth first search (BFS) and the depth first search (DFS) are the two algorithms used for traversing
and searching a node in a graph. They can also be used to find out whether a node is reachable from a given node
or not.

What is Recursion?
A.Recursion is a basic programming technique you can use in Java, in which a method calls itself to solve some
 problem. A method that uses this technique is recursive. Many programming problems can be solved only by recursion,
  and some problems that can be solved by other techniques are better solved by recursion

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
A. A linear data structure traverses the data elements sequentially, in which only one data element can directly
 be reached. Ex: Arrays, Linked Lists. Non-Linear data structure: Every data item is attached to several other data
  items in a way that is specific for reflecting relationships.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
A.Big O notation allows you to analyze algorithms in terms of overall efficiency and scaleability. It abstracts
 away constant order differences in efficiency which can vary from platform, language, OS to focus on the inherent
  efficiency of the algorithm and how it varies according to the size of the input.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
A.Algorithm	Data structure	Time complexity:
  Heap sort
  Smooth sort
    Bubble sort
  Insertion sort.

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and
disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
